# Lazyloading

If you enable lazyloading, it assumes you have installed the npm package `lazysizes`. 
To install just `npm i lazysizes`. More information can be found about lazysizes [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazysizes).

Once installed and lazysizes has been added to a page, it'll just work, no extra configuration needed.
